# Image-gallery-MDN

My version of MDN's Assessment: Image gallery

The objective of this assignment is "to test comprehension of JavaScript loops, functions, conditionals, and events". The goal is to emulate the program that creates an image gallery that can toggle between different images and can darken or lighten the selected image.
